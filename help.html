        <h2>Generating Emails</h2>
        <p>This program automatically generates and sends email alerts for unfinished jobs in the BYU Print and Mail Department.  To email a report to the person in charge of
            each area, upload the main excel report with all the unfinished jobs by clicking "Select File".  Then click the send emails button.  This will automatically generate
            excel files for each area and attach them to an email.
        </p>
        <h2>Saving Files</h2>
        <p>If you would like to see the reports for each area, but do not want to send emails out, you can choose the "Download Files".  This will create a folder with the current
            time and date, containing the excel files for each area.  These are the same files that would be attached to the emails.
        </p>
