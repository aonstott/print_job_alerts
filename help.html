        <h2>Generating Emails</h2>
        <p>This program automatically generates and sends email alerts for unfinished jobs in the BYU Print and Mail Department.  To email a report to the person in charge of
            each area, upload the main excel report with all the unfinished jobs by clicking "Select File".  Then click the send emails button.  This will automatically generate
            excel files for each area and attach them to an email.
        </p>
        <h2>Saving Files</h2>
        <p>If you would like to see the reports for each area, but do not want to send emails out, you can choose the "Download Files".  This will create a folder with the current
            time and date, containing the excel files for each area.  These are the same files that would be attached to the emails.
        </p>

    <h2>How This Program Works</h2>
    <p>This program uses an excel report of all unfinished jobs as its input.  It scans these jobs using a python script, and places them into a pandas dataframe.
        From the dataframe, it scans jobs by next task to be completed.  The cfg files are used to create a list of jobs that fall under each group.  These files also
        contain the email addresses of the group leaders.  The program then creates an excel file for each group, and attaches them to an email.  The email is sent to
        each group leader with the excel file and the number of unfinished jobs.

        The program was developed using python.  It was compiled into a windows executable using pyinstaller to make it simple to use for those who are not familiar with
        python.  Running the program will open the gui and a terminal window.  The terminal window will show basic information about what the program is doing, along with any errors.
        Any output labeled with "WARNING" indicates a problem with the program, and the developer should be contacted.
        
        
        NOTE: It is very important that the column names in the excel report are consistent.  The program
        will not work if the "Next Task" column is named something else.  In the case that the format is changed, please contact the developer to update the program.
        The program was originally written by Aaron Onstott, but in the case that he is no longer in the department, one of the other CSRs or developers should be able to
        help.
